1# The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

 typeScript -->  TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds a static typing system. That is, developers using TypeScript can predetermine the type of each variable in the code. Using the type system makes code more precise and manageable in large projects.


#Union type --> A union type is a type in TypeScript where a variable can hold multiple types of data.

#intersection type we can combine multiple types to form a new type, where each type's properties exist.
